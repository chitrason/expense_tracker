What most people dont realize is that income can also be overlooked. This app allows you to track your incomes and expenses through a CRUD operated app. The user is able to keep track of their finances by creating, editing and deleting their transactions. The user is also able to visualize their income versus expense stats within the last 30 days through a calculated net worth number and savings percentage.
